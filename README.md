# MIK Mappings Helper

## Overview

Google Apps Script for the [Move to Islandora Kit](https://github.com/MarcusBarnes/mik) [Mappings Helper](https://github.com/MarcusBarnes/mik/wiki/Metadata-Mappings-Helper).

## Using this code

This code is "[bound](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/bound)" to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. To use it in your own Sheets application, open the Sheets "Tools" menu, and then the "Script editor" submenu. Paste the code in the Code.gs file into the script editor and save.

The code contains an `onOpen()` function, which runs when the spreadsheet is opened.

## Thanks

Thanks to [@terrywbrady](https://github.com/terrywbrady/) for [his talk](https://github.com/terrywbrady/UsingAppScript) at [Code4lib BC](https://wiki.code4lib.org/BC) 2016, which alerted me to this approach to building a simple user tool for creating MIK mappings files.
